Nowadays, more and more opportunities are opening for women, however inequality between men and women is clearly seen.
From my perspective, some examples of sexal descremination still can be found, moreover beliefs in total equality are not exactly accurate.
First of all, many women have to suspend their careers while raising children.
This problem occurs mainly because there are no children places in the workplace, so women either have to find someone to look after their children or stay home.
Secondly, the beliefs that women are to raise their children themself are still deeply in people’s minds, it’s nonsense to see a man doing housework on television, since this is believed to be a woman's obligation.
Thirdly, families often needed to have both adults working to keep a good standard of living, so women usually found themself doing one job at home and another one at the office.
So, women's position has even deteriorated since their need to carry both jobs.
In contrast to that, many people say that poroblem of sexual descrimination no longes exists, since there are lows that prevent them from descremination; some women become pilots, judged.
Nevertheless, these examples are closer to an exception rather than norm, so descrimination is still within us.
All things considered, I would say women's position has not improved much.
While rules are changing, stereotypes are deeply rooted in people’s heads.
So, until these assurances will not be broken, women descrimination will remain a problem which we all need to face.
